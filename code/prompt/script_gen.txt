story2scene_step1_prompt = f"Check the provided story, ensuring it encompasses approximately {words_num} words. If the narrative falls short, enrich it by elaborating on character interactions, incorporating dialogues(quoted directly with double quotes), actions, and emotional expressions. For the sake of simplicity and understandability of the story, do not add unnecessary characters. The total number of characters should ideally not exceed three, and group characters should not appear in the story (such as neighbors, villagers). The plot's continuity and connections should also be fortyfied. Then several adjustments should be made. Firstly, adjust the naming of characters in the story in a way that preserves the original names, refining the approach to character naming without altering them. Note that changing Jimmy to Tom is considered an alteration, while changing Mr. Green(Tom's father) to Tom's father Mr. Green is not regarded as a change. Make the adjustments according to the rule below: A human character in the story should be choosed as the protagonist, and he should simply be referred to as his name. For example, Tom. Other human characters related to the protagonist should be named by their relationship to the protagonist, such as 'Tom's father Mr. Green', 'Tom's brother Jack', Tom's friend Kitty, Tom's friend Lucy and so on. For animal characters, use the kind followed by the specific name to name them, for example, 'The cat Jimmy, The tiger Wudy.' No punctuation is required between any name. The naming rules above must be strictly obeyed. So an example of characters for a story can be like: 'Tom's father Mr. Green, Tom's brother Jack, Tom's neighbour Mrs. Brown, Tom's friend Kitty, Tom's friend Lucy, The cat Jimmy, The tiger Wudy.' If there is no human character in the story, just follow the naming rules for animal characters. Whenever referring to a character in the story, obey the naming rules above. Secondly, for any object in the story, always name it with its color and shape, such as 'the red round ball, a blue toy car, etc.' Whenever referring to the object, use its full name containing the color and shape. Finally, Note that The story is aimed at a children's audience, so be mindful to avoid using uncommon depictions of character actions, environmental settings, and the like. Replace rare and complex animal characters in the story with animals from similar species common in daily life, such as cat, dog, bird, pig, tiger, wolve, bear, lion, monkey, etc. For example, If the character in the story is a porcupine, replace it with a pig. You should directly give the new version of the story without any other additional words. The original story is enclosed in three single quotes:\n"

story2scene_step2_prompt_2 = "\nI'm working on a vlog that narrates the story and need detailed descriptions for all characters and settings involved.\nCharacters can be devided into human characters and animal characters, and you should consider any man or animal that makes multiple appearances within the narrative as a character. The total number of characters should not exceed three, and group characters should not appear in the story (such as neighbors, villagers). Every character should be described separately, even if he is part of a group like a family or one's neighbors. The general groups that are not introduced individually should not be regarded as characters. When naming characters in the story, stricly adhere to the rule: ###A human character in the story should be choosed as the protagonist, and he should simply be referred to as his name. For example, Tom. Other human characters related to the protagonist should be named by their relationship to the protagonist, such as 'Tom's father Mr. Green', 'Tom's brother Jack', Tom's friend Kitty, Tom's friend Lucy and so on. For animal characters, use the kind followed by the specific name to name them, for example, 'The cat Jimmy, The tiger Wudy.' No punctuation is required between any name.### The naming rules above must be strictly obeyed. So an example of characters for a story can be like: 'Tom's father Mr. Green, Tom's brother Jack, Tom's neighbour Mrs. Brown, Tom's friend Kitty, Tom's friend Lucy, The cat Jimmy, The tiger Wudy.' If there is no human character in the story, just follow the naming rules for animal characters. Description comes after the name: For human characters, please format character descriptions as follows: 'Name: A brief introduction. detailed description, including hair, eyes, face shape, and clothing details (color + shirt, trousers, shoes). Clothes should be in solid colors and standard styles.' For example, 'Tom: An 8-year-old boy, curious and compassionate. Round face, short brown hair, wide blue eyes, wearing a red T-shirt, blue trousers, and red sneakers. Tom's father Mr. Green: A calm and thoughtful man. Square jaw, dark short-cut hair, deep-set brown eyes, wearing a plain white shirt, blue jeans, and brown boots.' For animal characters, please format character descriptions as follows: 'Name: A brief introduction (end with the animal kind). Major characteristics, especially fur color and eye color (solid color preferred).' For example, 'The cat Jimmy: A vibrant cat, with sleek orange fur, piercing green eyes, and a narrow, angular face. The pirrot Jerry: A smart parrot, with bright green feather and black eyes.' Note that description for a character should be simple and clear, and in 30 words.\nAs for settings in the story, avoid including any humans or animals or their activities in the descriptions, such as 'a place where kids play'. The background color in the setting should be distinctly different from the clothing and skin tone of the characters, with a strong contrast. For example, since the characters have flesh-colored skin, yellow should not be used as the background color. For those settings with buildings, avoid using overly broad distant concepts, such as 'village (outdoor)' or 'school (outdoor)'. You should ormat setting descriptions as follows: 'Name (Indoor/Outdoor): A brief introduction of the major elements in simple styles and colors.' Specify whether the setting is indoor or outdoor. For example, 'Tom's House (Outdoor): A cozy, single-story with a small porch. Blue walls, large window on one side.' Note that description for a setting should be simple and clear, and in 30 words.\nYour answer should be in the format:\n'Characters list:[A, B, C, ......]\nSettings list:[A, B, C, ......]\nPart 1.
